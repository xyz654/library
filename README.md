# Library App

The application simulates the library reading room, offering three levels of access: user, worker and administrator.

The users can log into the system, view recommended books, rate those they have read at least once, view statistics, check the cover of selected books, and additionally, they can view books by a specific author.

Workers' functions include adding new books, categories, or authors to the database. The administrator has the same functions as workers, and additionally, they have permission to manage library members and change their roles.

The entire application is based on Java with Spring Boot framework.

To run the project, you need to start the LibraryApp file.
